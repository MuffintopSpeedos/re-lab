OLE Toy is a set of Python scripts to parse and view contents of various 
binary file formats. Originally OLE Toy was developed for 
reverse-engineering of Microsoft Publisher file format, but later support 
for more of them was added, partially written from scratch, partially 
moved from our earlier work.

As of now OLE Toy reads and parses:

- PUB (Microsoft Publisher ver 98/2k and 2002 to 2010)
- VSD, VSS (Microsoft Visio, ver 1-11)
- DOC (Microsoft Word)
- XLS (Microsoft Excel)
- PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- MDB (Microsoft Access)
- VBA (Microsoft Office)
- RTF (Microsoft Office)
- CLP (Microsoft clipboard)
- FH (Macromedia Freehand ver.7 to 11)
- QPW (QuattroPro spreadsheets)
- SVM (StarOffice)
- PPP (old PagePlus files, BIPU support)
- CDR (CorelDRAW ver. 3 to 16)
- WLD (CorelDRAW ver. 1 and 2)
- CMX (CorelDRAW)
- CPL (CorelDRAW palette)
- CDW ("Kompas" unknown version, files were picked on Inet)
- ABR/GRD (Adobe brushes and gradients)
- ICC (colour profiles)
- EMF, EMF+, WMF (Microsoft)
- REX, RX2 (Propellerheads ReCycle)
- XML
- CDX (CambridgeSoft ChemDraw, BIPU support)
- LRF (Sony BroadBand EBook, also known as BBeB)
- PDB (various Palm-based e-book formats, currently eReader, Plucker,
       PalmDoc, TealDoc, zTXT, iSilo ver. 1 to 3 and TomeRaider3. iSilo
       and TomeRaider3 only shows basic structure, because the format is
       not known.)
- WPD (Software602 602Text; this format has nothing in common with
       WordPerfect.)
- IMP (SoftBook e-book)
- ZMF (Zoner Callisto, also known as Zoner Draw)
- ZBR (Zoner Zebra)
- BMI (Zoner Bitmap)
- IWA (Apple iWork '13. This format is used by Keynote 6, Pages 5 and
       Numbers 3, with a big chunk of the internals shared among all
       three applications. Support for Numbers is BIPU.)
- WLS (Software602 602Tab, aka MagicTab)
- TC6, GC6 (Software602 C602)
- PLIST (Apple property list)
- 602 (Software602 T602)

Dependencies:
- PyGTK (sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 for Ubuntu).
- libgsf for OLE-based formats. You can find libgsf source code here:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libgsf/
    (or sudo apt-get install libgsf-bin libgsf-1-dev for Ubuntu).

To start OLE Toy just run:

$ ./view.py
